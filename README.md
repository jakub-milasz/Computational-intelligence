# Computational intelligence in data analysis
Here you can find projects using Artificial Intelligence algorithms.
1. Approximation of PI value using Monte Carlo.
2. Travelling Salesman Problem: Genetic Algorithm with Roulette and Tournament Selection Comparison.
3. Fuzzy highway hazard assessment system using skfuzzy.
4. Neural Network used to predict a value.
It is better to download notebooks because of problem with rendering plots on github.
